### Lizzy McAlpine - Older (and Wiser) - 2024  
<br>
**6 October 2024**

I started listening to this on Sunday afternoon, after our call. I couldn't have asked for a more fitting first track. That filled me with joy. 
<br>
But the rest of the album doesn't feel very notable to me; just a larger, longer iteration of her previous work. Soft, wistful, and a little melancholic. In my opinion, there's nothing particularly innovative or genius about it. It is not unpleasant! But it is not extraordinary. 
<br>
Songs I like include "All Falls Down" and "Method Acting" (I tend to have a soft spot for demos). Not for lyrics necessarily, just for vibes. 
<br>
Will I have this album on loop? Definitely not. Maybe I'll pull a song out every now and then for a sad playlist, who knows. 
<br>
**OVERALL: 3/5 STARS**

### Charli XCX and Bon Iver - I think about it all the time featuring bon iver - 2024  
<br>
**11 October 2024**

<br>
**Naomi**  

I really like hyperpop in theory. It is an unarguably gay genre, dominated by queer artists and consumed en masse by queer people. To me, that has something to do with the subversive appeal of taking a culturally "feminine" thing -- in this case, the bubbly, women-dominated pop sound -- and exaggerating it to the extreme to make something dramatic, unapologetic, and almost grating. It's appealing because it plays with expectations by being simultaneously derived from musical norms and still uniquely counter to them. It's pop music in drag. 
<br>
Charli XCX is at the forefront of hyperpop, and obviously an icon for the gays, so I feel the need to give her songs a chance on those grounds alone. I can concede that she has released some incredible beats for drunk nights on the dance floor (Hot In It was an invaluable part of my gay London party era), but honestly, I don't like the majority of her stuff.
<br>
Regarding this particular single: songs that are basically just someone talking over a set of synthetic noises sometimes work for me (see: BROCKHAMPTON) but not this time. The verses don't feel rhythmic or musical at all. The chorus and Bon Iver's contributions are the only salvageable parts, but they're not doing enough to carry the song.
<br>
I must also say that I can hear Kendall's voice in my head whenever I listen to anything Charli, and I know that she would argue that the lyrics to this one are deep . . . but I'm not sure I agree with her. And the line about walking through Stockholm didn't make it into this version, so I can't even give the song points for that.
<br>
The world agreed this was a brat summer, but let's leave it there. I can't support a brat fall.
<br>
**OVERALL: 2/5 STARS**

<br>
