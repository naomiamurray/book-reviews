### Lizzy McAlpine - Older (and Wiser) - 2024  
<br>
**6 October 2024**

I started listening to this on Sunday afternoon, after our call. I couldn't have asked for a more fitting first track. That filled me with joy. 
<br>
But the rest of the album doesn't feel very notable to me; just a larger, longer iteration of her previous work. Soft, wistful, and a little melancholic. In my opinion, there's nothing particularly innovative or genius about it. It is not unpleasant! But it is not extraordinary. 
<br>
Songs I like include "All Falls Down" and "Method Acting" (I tend to have a soft spot for demos). Not for lyrics necessarily, just for vibes. 
<br>
Will I have this album on loop? Definitely not. Maybe I'll pull a song out every now and then for a sad playlist, who knows. 
<br>
**OVERALL: 3/5 STARS** 

<br>
