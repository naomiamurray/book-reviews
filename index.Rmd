### Lizzy McAlpine - Older (and Wiser) - 2024  
<br>
**6 October 2024**

I started listening to this on Sunday afternoon, after we decided to try to stay together. I couldn't have asked for a more fitting first track. That filled me with joy. 
<br>
But, the rest of the album doesn't feel exceptionally notable to me; just a larger, longer iteration of her previous work. In my opinion, there's nothing particularly innovative or genius about it. It is not unpleasant! But it is not extraordinary.
